### <i>Build & Execute</i>
- [x] Execute test suite that can be a combination between front-end and back-end test scenarios as a single test. 
      Framework structure supports full end to end testing (without performance and load). Extended framework 
      structure improves efficiency of every automated test. 
- [x] Test coverage and high code re-usability are improved by separated test methods. A single test scenario can be 
      re executed with multiple test data. This methodology reduces the number of test code required to test scenarios
      and data is easier to modify.  
- [x] Framework provides the fastest way to generate a test suite. Test methods that calls different actions like
      <i>login, get products list, place order, etc.</i> provides structure that requires less coding as it covers 
      all the possible combination of test scenarios.
